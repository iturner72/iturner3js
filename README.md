## Digital Trinket Docs

### Quickstart
I have decided that since I was already using Git from the beginning for the
trinket development, that I would point people in the community to it since
it's open source by default.

I will provide 2 different methods for running the three.js models. The only
editing you will need to do would be to download the model files and images. In
the first case you will need to install some software, in the second case I will
attempt to make a Repl so it's ez pz.
